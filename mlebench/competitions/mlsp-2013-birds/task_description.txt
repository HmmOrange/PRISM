Given a 10-second audio clip of bird sounds, predict the presence of 19 bird species in a multi-label classification task. The audio may contain multiple simultaneously vocalizing birds, non-bird sounds (e.g., insects), and background noise (e.g., wind, rain).
There are 19 possible bird species, each identified by a class index from 0 to 18 as follows:
0  - Brown Creeper  
1  - Pacific Wren  
2  - Pacific-slope Flycatcher  
3  - Red-breasted Nuthatch  
4  - Dark-eyed Junco  
5  - Olive-sided Flycatcher  
6  - Hermit Thrush  
7  - Chestnut-backed Chickadee  
8  - Varied Thrush  
9  - Hermit Warbler  
10 - Swainson's Thrush  
11 - Hammond's Flycatcher  
12 - Western Tanager  
13 - Black-headed Grosbeak  
14 - Golden Crowned Kinglet  
15 - Warbling Vireo  
16 - MacGillivray's Warbler  
17 - Stellar's Jay  
18 - Common Nighthawk  
Return a string of the class indices of the predicted bird species, separated by commas (e.g., "2,3,10).
