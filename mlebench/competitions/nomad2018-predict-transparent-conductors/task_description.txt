Given the properties of a material, including its spacegroup, total number of Al, Ga, In, and O atoms in the unit cell, relative compositions (x, y, z), lattice vectors (lv1, lv2, lv3), lattice angles (α, β, γ), and atomic spatial positions, predict its formation energy and bandgap energy to identify potential transparent conductors. Return a list of two float values: [formation_energy_ev_natom, bandgap_energy_ev], representing the predicted formation energy (in eV/atom) and bandgap energy (in eV), respectively.
