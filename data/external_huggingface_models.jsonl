Default is True.\n)\nmodel_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors=\"pt\").to(model.device)\n\n# conduct text completion\ngenerated_ids = model.generate(\n    **model_inputs,\n    max_new_tokens=32768\n)\noutput_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist() \n\n# parsing thinking content\ntry:\n    # rindex finding 151668 (</think>)\n    index = len(output_ids) - output_ids[::-1].index(151668)\nexcept ValueError:\n    index = 0\n\nthinking_content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[:index], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\ncontent = tokenizer.decode(output_ids[index:], skip_special_tokens=True).strip(\"\\n\")\n\nprint(\"thinking content:\", thinking_content)\nprint(\"content:\", content)\n```\n\nFor deployment, you can use `sglang>=0.4.6.post1` or `vllm>=0.8.5` or to create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint:\n- SGLang:\n    ```shell\n    python -m sglang.launch_server --model-path Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --reasoning-parser qwen3\n    ```\n- vLLM:\n    ```shell\n    vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B --enable-reasoning --reasoning-parser deepseek_r1\n    ```\n\nFor local use, applications such as Ollama, LMStudio, MLX-LM, llama.cpp, and KTransformers have also supported Qwen3.\n\n## Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Mode\n\n> [!TIP]\n> The `enable_thinking` switch is also available in APIs created by SGLang and vLLM. \n> Please refer to our documentation for [SGLang](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/sglang.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) and [vLLM](https://qwen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/vllm.html#thinking-non-thinking-modes) users.\n\n### `enable_thinking=True`\n\nBy default, Qwen3 has thinking capabilities enabled, similar to QwQ-32B. This means the model will use its reasoning abilities to enhance the quality of generated responses. For example, when explicitly setting `enable_thinking=True` or leaving it as the default value in `tokenizer.apply_chat_template`, the model will engage its thinking mode.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=True  # True is the default value for enable_thinking\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will generate think content wrapped in a `<think>...</think>` block, followed by the final response.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For thinking mode, use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0` (the default setting in `generation_config.json`). **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.\n\n\n### `enable_thinking=False`\n\nWe provide a hard switch to strictly disable the model's thinking behavior, aligning its functionality with the previous Qwen2.5-Instruct models. This mode is particularly useful in scenarios where disabling thinking is essential for enhancing efficiency.\n\n```python\ntext = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n    messages,\n    tokenize=False,\n    add_generation_prompt=True,\n    enable_thinking=False  # Setting enable_thinking=False disables thinking mode\n)\n```\n\nIn this mode, the model will not generate any think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For non-thinking mode, we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. For more detailed guidance, please refer to the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.\n\n### Advanced Usage: Switching Between Thinking and Non-Thinking Modes via User Input\n\nWe provide a soft switch mechanism that allows users to dynamically control the model's behavior when `enable_thinking=True`. Specifically, you can add `/think` and `/no_think` to user prompts or system messages to switch the model's thinking mode from turn to turn. The model will follow the most recent instruction in multi-turn conversations.\n\nHere is an example of a multi-turn conversation:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nclass QwenChatbot:\n    def __init__(self, model_name=\"Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B\"):\n        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)\n        self.history = []\n\n    def generate_response(self, user_input):\n        messages = self.history + [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}]\n\n        text = self.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(\n            messages,\n            tokenize=False,\n            add_generation_prompt=True\n        )\n\n        inputs = self.tokenizer(text, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n        response_ids = self.model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=32768)[0][len(inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()\n        response = self.tokenizer.decode(response_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n\n        # Update history\n        self.history.append({\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input})\n        self.history.append({\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": response})\n\n        return response\n\n# Example Usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    chatbot = QwenChatbot()\n\n    # First input (without /think or /no_think tags, thinking mode is enabled by default)\n    user_input_1 = \"How many r's in strawberries?\"\n    print(f\"User: {user_input_1}\")\n    response_1 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_1)\n    print(f\"Bot: {response_1}\")\n    print(\"----------------------\")\n\n    # Second input with /no_think\n    user_input_2 = \"Then, how many r's in blueberries? /no_think\"\n    print(f\"User: {user_input_2}\")\n    response_2 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_2)\n    print(f\"Bot: {response_2}\") \n    print(\"----------------------\")\n\n    # Third input with /think\n    user_input_3 = \"Really? /think\"\n    print(f\"User: {user_input_3}\")\n    response_3 = chatbot.generate_response(user_input_3)\n    print(f\"Bot: {response_3}\")\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For API compatibility, when `enable_thinking=True`, regardless of whether the user uses `/think` or `/no_think`, the model will always output a block wrapped in `<think>...</think>`. However, the content inside this block may be empty if thinking is disabled.\n> When `enable_thinking=False`, the soft switches are not valid. Regardless of any `/think` or `/no_think` tags input by the user, the model will not generate think content and will not include a `<think>...</think>` block.\n\n## Agentic Use\n\nQwen3 excels in tool calling capabilities. We recommend using [Qwen-Agent](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen-Agent) to make the best use of agentic ability of Qwen3. Qwen-Agent encapsulates tool-calling templates and tool-calling parsers internally, greatly reducing coding complexity.\n\nTo define the available tools, you can use the MCP configuration file, use the integrated tool of Qwen-Agent, or integrate other tools by yourself.\n```python\nfrom qwen_agent.agents import Assistant\n\n# Define LLM\nllm_cfg = {\n    'model': 'Qwen3-0.6B',\n\n    # Use the endpoint provided by Alibaba Model Studio:\n    # 'model_type': 'qwen_dashscope',\n    # 'api_key': os.getenv('DASHSCOPE_API_KEY'),\n\n    # Use a custom endpoint compatible with OpenAI API:\n    'model_server': 'http://localhost:8000/v1',  # api_base\n    'api_key': 'EMPTY',\n\n    # Other parameters:\n    # 'generate_cfg': {\n    #         # Add: When the response content is `<think>this is the thought</think>this is the answer;\n    #         # Do not add: When the response has been separated by reasoning_content and content.\n    #         'thought_in_content': True,\n    #     },\n}\n\n# Define Tools\ntools = [\n    {'mcpServers': {  # You can specify the MCP configuration file\n            'time': {\n                'command': 'uvx',\n                'args': ['mcp-server-time', '--local-timezone=Asia/Shanghai']\n            },\n            \"fetch\": {\n                \"command\": \"uvx\",\n                \"args\": [\"mcp-server-fetch\"]\n            }\n        }\n    },\n  'code_interpreter',  # Built-in tools\n]\n\n# Define Agent\nbot = Assistant(llm=llm_cfg, function_list=tools)\n\n# Streaming generation\nmessages = [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'https://qwenlm.github.io/blog/ Introduce the latest developments of Qwen'}]\nfor responses in bot.run(messages=messages):\n    pass\nprint(responses)\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\nTo achieve optimal performance, we recommend the following settings:\n\n1. **Sampling Parameters**:\n   - For thinking mode (`enable_thinking=True`), use `Temperature=0.6`, `TopP=0.95`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`. **DO NOT use greedy decoding**, as it can lead to performance degradation and endless repetitions.\n   - For non-thinking mode (`enable_thinking=False`), we suggest using `Temperature=0.7`, `TopP=0.8`, `TopK=20`, and `MinP=0`.\n   - For supported frameworks, you can adjust the `presence_penalty` parameter between 0 and 2 to reduce endless repetitions. However, using a higher value may occasionally result in language mixing and a slight decrease in model performance.\n\n2. **Adequate Output Length**: We recommend using an output length of 32,768 tokens for most queries. For benchmarking on highly complex problems, such as those found in math and programming competitions, we suggest setting the max output length to 38,912 tokens. This provides the model with sufficient space to generate detailed and comprehensive responses, thereby enhancing its overall performance.\n\n3. **Standardize Output Format**: We recommend using prompts to standardize model outputs when benchmarking.\n   - **Math Problems**: Include \"Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\" in the prompt.\n   - **Multiple-Choice Questions**: Add the following JSON structure to the prompt to standardize responses: \"Please show your choice in the `answer` field with only the choice letter, e.g., `\"answer\": \"C\"`.\"\n\n4. **No Thinking Content in History**: In multi-turn conversations, the historical model output should only include the final output part and does not need to include the thinking content. It is implemented in the provided chat template in Jinja2. However, for frameworks that do not directly use the Jinja2 chat template, it is up to the developers to ensure that the best practice is followed.\n\n### Citation\n\nIf you find our work helpful, feel free to give us a cite.\n\n```\n@misc{qwen3technicalreport,\n      title={Qwen3 Technical Report}, \n      author={Qwen Team},\n      year={2025},\n      eprint={2505.09388},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL},\n      url={https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09388}, \n}\n```", "downloads": 4385638, "likes": 606, "meta": {"base_model": ["Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-Base"], "library_name": "transformers", "license": "apache-2.0", "license_link": "https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B/blob/main/LICENSE", "pipeline_tag": "text-generation"}, "inference_type": "local"}

This specific model, named \"google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k,\" is pre-trained on a substantial collection of images in a supervised manner, leveraging the ImageNet-21k dataset. The images in the pre-training dataset are resized to a resolution of 224x224 pixels, making it suitable for a wide range of image recognition tasks.\n\nDuring the training phase, meticulous attention was given to hyperparameter settings to ensure optimal model performance. The model was fine-tuned with a judiciously chosen batch size of 16. This choice not only balanced computational efficiency but also allowed for the model to effectively process and learn from a diverse array of images.\n\nTo facilitate this fine-tuning process, a learning rate of 5e-5 was employed. The learning rate serves as a critical tuning parameter that dictates the magnitude of adjustments made to the model's parameters during training. In this case, a learning rate of 5e-5 was selected to strike a harmonious balance between rapid convergence and steady optimization, resulting in a model that not only learns swiftly but also steadily refines its capabilities throughout the training process.\n\nThis training phase was executed using a proprietary dataset containing an extensive collection of 80,000 images, each characterized by a substantial degree of variability. The dataset was thoughtfully curated to include two distinct classes, namely \"normal\" and \"nsfw.\" This diversity allowed the model to grasp nuanced visual patterns, equipping it with the competence to accurately differentiate between safe and explicit content.\n\nThe overarching objective of this meticulous training process was to impart the model with a deep understanding of visual cues, ensuring its robustness and competence in tackling the specific task of NSFW image classification. The result is a model that stands ready to contribute significantly to content safety and moderation, all while maintaining the highest standards of accuracy and reliability.\n## Intended Uses & Limitations\n\n### Intended Uses\n- **NSFW Image Classification**: The primary intended use of this model is for the classification of NSFW (Not Safe for Work) images. It has been fine-tuned for this purpose, making it suitable for filtering explicit or inappropriate content in various applications.\n\n### How to use\nHere is how to use this model to classifiy an image based on 1 of 2 classes (normal,nsfw):\n\n```markdown\n\n# Use a pipeline as a high-level helper\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\nimg = Image.open(\"<path_to_image_file>\")\nclassifier = pipeline(\"image-classification\", model=\"Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection\")\nclassifier(img)\n\n```\n\n<hr>\n\n``` markdown\n\n# Load model directly\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForImageClassification, ViTImageProcessor\n\nimg = Image.open(\"<path_to_image_file>\")\nmodel = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(\"Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection\")\nprocessor = ViTImageProcessor.from_pretrained('Falconsai/nsfw_image_detection')\nwith torch.no_grad():\n    inputs = processor(images=img, return_tensors=\"pt\")\n    outputs = model(**inputs)\n    logits = outputs.logits\n\npredicted_label = logits.argmax(-1).item()\nmodel.config.id2label[predicted_label]\n\n```\n\n<hr>\nRun Yolo Version\n\n``` markdown\n\nimport os\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport numpy as np\nimport onnxruntime as ort\nimport json # Added import for json\n\n# Predict using YOLOv9 model\ndef predict_with_yolov9(image_path, model_path, labels_path, input_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Run inference using the converted YOLOv9 model on a single image.\n\n    Args:\n        image_path (str): Path to the input image file.\n        model_path (str): Path to the ONNX model file.\n        labels_path (str): Path to the JSON file containing class labels.\n        input_size (tuple): The expected input size (height, width) for the model.\n\n    Returns:\n        str: The predicted class label.\n        PIL.Image.Image: The original loaded image.\n    \"\"\"\n    def load_json(file_path):\n        with open(file_path, \"r\") as f:\n            return json.load(f)\n\n    # Load labels\n    labels = load_json(labels_path)\n\n    # Preprocess image\n    original_image = Image.open(image_path).convert(\"RGB\")\n    image_resized = original_image.resize(input_size, Image.Resampling.BILINEAR)\n    image_np = np.array(image_resized, dtype=np.float32) / 255.0\n    image_np = np.transpose(image_np, (2, 0, 1))  # [C, H, W]\n    input_tensor = np.expand_dims(image_np, axis=0).astype(np.float32)\n\n    # Load YOLOv9 model\n    session = ort.InferenceSession(model_path)\n    input_name = session.get_inputs()[0].name\n    output_name = session.get_outputs()[0].name # Assuming classification output\n\n    # Run inference\n    outputs = session.run([output_name], {input_name: input_tensor})\n    predictions = outputs[0]\n\n    # Postprocess predictions (assuming classification output)\n    # Adapt this section if your model output is different (e.g., detection boxes)\n    predicted_index = np.argmax(predictions)\n    predicted_label = labels[str(predicted_index)] # Assumes labels are indexed by string numbers\n\n    return predicted_label, original_image\n\n# Display prediction for a single image\ndef display_single_prediction(image_path, model_path, labels_path, input_size):\n    \"\"\"\n    Predicts the class for a single image and displays the image with its prediction.\n\n    Args:\n        image_path (str): Path to the input image file.\n        model_path (str): Path to the ONNX model file.\n        labels_path (str): Path to the JSON file containing class labels.\n        input_size (tuple): The expected input size (height, width) for the model.\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        # Run prediction\n        prediction, img = predict_with_yolov9(image_path, model_path, labels_path, input_size)\n\n        # Display image and prediction\n        fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(8, 8)) # Create a single plot\n        ax.imshow(img)\n        ax.set_title(f\"Prediction: {prediction}\", fontsize=14)\n        ax.axis(\"off\") # Hide axes ticks and labels\n\n        plt.tight_layout()\n        plt.show()\n\n    except FileNotFoundError:\n        print(f\"Error: Image file not found at {image_path}\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n\n\n# --- Main Execution ---\n\n# Paths and parameters -

It was\nintroduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108). The code for the distillation process can be found\n[here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/main/examples/research_projects/distillation). This model is uncased: it does\nnot make a difference between english and English.\n\n## Model description\n\nDistilBERT is a transformers model, smaller and faster than BERT, which was pretrained on the same corpus in a\nself-supervised fashion, using the BERT base model as a teacher. This means it was pretrained on the raw texts only,\nwith no humans labelling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of publicly available data) with an automatic\nprocess to generate inputs and labels from those texts using the BERT base model. More precisely, it was pretrained\nwith three objectives:\n\n- Distillation loss: the model was trained to return the same probabilities as the BERT base model.\n- Masked language modeling (MLM): this is part of the original training loss of the BERT base model. When taking a\n  sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run the entire masked sentence through the\n  model and has to predict the masked words. This is different from traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that\n  usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like GPT which internally mask the future\n  tokens. It allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the sentence.\n- Cosine embedding loss: the model was also trained to generate hidden states as close as possible as the BERT base\n  model.\n\nThis way, the model learns the same inner representation of the English language than its teacher model, while being\nfaster for inference or downstream tasks.\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to\nbe fine-tuned on a downstream task. See the [model hub](https://huggingface.co/models?filter=distilbert) to look for\nfine-tuned versions on a task that interests you.\n\nNote that this model is primarily aimed at being fine-tuned on tasks that use the whole sentence (potentially masked)\nto make decisions, such as sequence classification, token classification or question answering. For tasks such as text\ngeneration you should look at model like GPT2.\n\n### How to use\n\nYou can use this model directly with a pipeline for masked language modeling:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='distilbert-base-uncased')\n>>> unmasker(\"Hello I'm a [MASK] model.\")\n\n[{'sequence': \"[CLS] hello i'm a role model.

It also inherits some of\n[the bias of its teacher model](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased#limitations-and-bias).\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='distilbert-base-uncased')\n>>> unmasker(\"The White man worked as a [MASK].\")\n\n[{'sequence': '[CLS] the white man worked as a blacksmith.

This model is uncased: it does not make a difference\nbetween english and English.\n\nDisclaimer: The team releasing BERT did not write a model card for this model so this model card has been written by\nthe Hugging Face team.\n\n## Model description\n\nBERT is a transformers model pretrained on a large corpus of English data in a self-supervised fashion. This means it\nwas pretrained on the raw texts only, with no humans labeling them in any way (which is why it can use lots of\npublicly available data) with an automatic process to generate inputs and labels from those texts. More precisely, it\nwas pretrained with two objectives:\n\n- Masked language modeling (MLM): taking a sentence, the model randomly masks 15% of the words in the input then run\n  the entire masked sentence through the model and has to predict the masked words. This is different from traditional\n  recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that usually see the words one after the other, or from autoregressive models like\n  GPT which internally masks the future tokens. It allows the model to learn a bidirectional representation of the\n  sentence.\n- Next sentence prediction (NSP): the models concatenates two masked sentences as inputs during pretraining. Sometimes\n  they correspond to sentences that were next to each other in the original text, sometimes not. The model then has to\n  predict if the two sentences were following each other or not.\n\nThis way, the model learns an inner representation of the English language that can then be used to extract features\nuseful for downstream tasks: if you have a dataset of labeled sentences, for instance, you can train a standard\nclassifier using the features produced by the BERT model as inputs.\n\n## Model variations\n\nBERT has originally been released in base and large variations, for cased and uncased input text. The uncased models also strips out an accent markers.  \nChinese and multilingual uncased and cased versions followed shortly after.  \nModified preprocessing with whole word masking has replaced subpiece masking in a following work, with the release of two models.  \nOther 24 smaller models are released afterward.  \n\nThe detailed release history can be found on the [google-research/bert readme](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/README.md) on github.\n\n| Model | #params | Language |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------|-------|\n| [`bert-base-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) | 110M   | English |\n| [`bert-large-uncased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased)              | 340M    | English | sub \n| [`bert-base-cased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-cased)        | 110M    | English |\n| [`bert-large-cased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-cased) | 340M    |  English |\n| [`bert-base-chinese`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-chinese) | 110M    | Chinese |\n| [`bert-base-multilingual-cased`](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-multilingual-cased) | 110M | Multiple |\n| [`bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking`](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-uncased-whole-word-masking) | 340M | English |\n| [`bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking`](https://huggingface.co/bert-large-cased-whole-word-masking) | 340M | English |\n\n## Intended uses & limitations\n\nYou can use the raw model for either masked language modeling or next sentence prediction, but it's mostly intended to\nbe fine-tuned on a downstream task.

Therefore, the model can have biased predictions:\n\n```python\n>>> from transformers import pipeline\n>>> unmasker = pipeline('fill-mask', model='roberta-base')\n>>> unmasker(\"The man worked as a <mask>.\")\n\n[{'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a mechanic.</s>',\n  'score': 0.08702439814805984,\n  'token': 25682,\n  'token_str': 'Ġmechanic'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a waiter.</s>',\n  'score': 0.0819653645157814,\n  'token': 38233,\n  'token_str': 'Ġwaiter'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a butcher.</s>',\n  'score': 0.073323555290699,\n  'token': 32364,\n  'token_str': 'Ġbutcher'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a miner.</s>',\n  'score': 0.046322137117385864,\n  'token': 18678,\n  'token_str': 'Ġminer'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The man worked as a guard.</s>',\n  'score': 0.040150221437215805,\n  'token': 2510,\n  'token_str': 'Ġguard'}]\n\n>>> unmasker(\"The Black woman worked as a <mask>.\")\n\n[{'sequence': '<s>The Black woman worked as a waitress.</s>',\n  'score': 0.22177888453006744,\n  'token': 35698,\n  'token_str': 'Ġwaitress'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The Black woman worked as a prostitute.</s>',\n  'score': 0.19288744032382965,\n  'token': 36289,\n  'token_str': 'Ġprostitute'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The Black woman worked as a maid.</s>',\n  'score': 0.06498628109693527,\n  'token': 29754,\n  'token_str': 'Ġmaid'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The Black woman worked as a secretary.</s>',\n  'score': 0.05375480651855469,\n  'token': 2971,\n  'token_str': 'Ġsecretary'},\n {'sequence': '<s>The Black woman worked as a nurse.</s>',\n  'score': 0.05245552211999893,\n  'token': 9008,\n  'token_str': 'Ġnurse'}]\n```\n\nThis bias will also affect all fine-tuned versions of this model.\n\n## Training data\n\nThe RoBERTa model was pretrained on the reunion of five datasets:\n- [BookCorpus](https://yknzhu.wixsite.com/mbweb), a dataset consisting of 11,038 unpublished books;\n- [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia) (excluding lists, tables and headers) ;\n- [CC-News](https://commoncrawl.org/2016/10/news-dataset-available/), a dataset containing 63 millions English news\n  articles crawled between September 2016 and February 2019.\n- [OpenWebText](https://github.com/jcpeterson/openwebtext), an opensource recreation of the WebText dataset used to\n  train GPT-2,\n- [Stories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02847) a dataset containing a subset of CommonCrawl data filtered to match the\n  story-like style of Winograd schemas.\n\nTogether these datasets weigh 160GB of text.\n\n## Training procedure\n\n### Preprocessing\n\nThe texts are tokenized using a byte version of Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) and a vocabulary size of 50,000. The inputs of\nthe model take pieces of 512 contiguous tokens that may span over documents. The beginning of a new document is marked\nwith `<s>` and the end of one by `</s>`\n\nThe details of the masking procedure for each sentence are the following:\n- 15% of the tokens are masked.\n- In 80% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by `<mask>`.\n- In 10% of the cases, the masked tokens are replaced by a random token (different) from the one they replace.\n- In the 10% remaining cases, the masked tokens are left as is.\n\nContrary to BERT, the masking is done dynamically during pretraining (e.g., it changes at each epoch and is not fixed).\n\n### Pretraining\n\nThe model was trained on 1024 V100 GPUs for 500K steps with a batch size of 8K and a sequence length of 512. The\noptimizer used is Adam with a learning rate of 6e-4, \\\\(\\beta_{1} = 0.9\\\\), \\\\(\\beta_{2} = 0.98\\\\) and\n\\\\(\\epsilon = 1e-6\\\\), a weight decay of 0.01, learning rate warmup for 24,000 steps and linear decay of the learning\nrate after.\n\n## Evaluation results\n\nWhen fine-tuned on downstream tasks, this model achieves the following results:\n\nGlue test results:\n\n| Task | MNLI | QQP  | QNLI | SST-2 | CoLA | STS-B | MRPC | RTE  |\n|:----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|\n|      | 87.6 | 91.9 | 92.8 | 94.8  | 63.6 | 91.2  | 90.2 | 78.7 |\n\n\n### BibTeX entry and citation info\n\n```bibtex\n@article{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1907-11692,\n  author    = {Yinhan Liu and\n               Myle Ott and\n               Naman Goyal and\n               Jingfei Du and\n               Mandar Joshi and\n               Danqi Chen and\n               Omer Levy and\n               Mike Lewis and\n               Luke Zettlemoyer and\n               Veselin Stoyanov},\n  title     = {RoBERTa: {A} Robustly Optimized {BERT} Pretraining Approach},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1907.11692},\n  year      = {2019},\n  url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692},\n  archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n  eprint    = {1907.11692},\n  timestamp = {Thu, 01 Aug 2019 08:59:33 +0200},\n  biburl    = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-1907-11692.bib},\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n```\n\n<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/exbert/?model=roberta-base\">\n\t<img width=\"300px\" src=\"https://cdn-media.huggingface.co/exbert/button.png\">\n</a>\n", "downloads": 11303444, "likes": 523, "meta": {"datasets": ["bookcorpus", "wikipedia"], "language": "en", "license": "mit", "tags": ["exbert"]}, "inference_type": "huggingface"}
